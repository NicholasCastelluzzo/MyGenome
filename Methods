When doing Sequence quality and trimming, I followed the instructions quite carefully everytime it was involved, as this gave me the most difficulty. 
First, I ran fastqc to check my base reads to make sure they were ready for trimming by running:
'''bash  $env:DISPLAY = "localhost:0" ''' before logging onto my VM with a -Y mod. This configured my machine to be able to run fastqc in my VM.
I then ran "fastqc &" to open everything.
Once I verifired that, I then downloaded the trimmomatic program onto my VM then ran it with my forward and backwards sequence reads using the following command line tool:

'''bash  java -jar trimmomatic-0.38 PE -threads 2 -phred33 Bm88509_1.fq.gz Bm88509_2.fq.gz Bm88509_paired_1.fq.gz
Bm88509_unpaired_1.fq.gz Bm88509_paired_2.fq.gz Bm88509_unpaired_2.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:adaptors.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:20:20 MINLEN: 100  '''

This gave me my paired and unpaired output trimmed files, of which you can see the html outputs in this repository.
These files also gave me the ability to run the command line tools to find: the # of single end raw reads (8214741), 
the # of cleaned reads used for assembly (7612219), and the total # of bases in my cleaned reads (2277218354). 
You can see the code for how I got these values in the README file in this repository.
